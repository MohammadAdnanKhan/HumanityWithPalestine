The Balfour Declaration,https://workingclasshistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/11.02-Balfour-declaration-collage-1024x710.jpg,"          <p>
            Issued on November 2, 1917, the Balfour Declaration marked a
            turning point for Palestinians. In this public letter, British
            Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour pledged support for “a
            national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine—without consulting
            the indigenous Arab majority, who made up over 90% of the
            population.
            <br />
            <br />
            While the declaration vaguely promised not to prejudice the rights
            of non-Jewish communities, the British mandate was structured in a
            way that enabled and empowered Jewish immigration and political
            self-rule, while marginalizing Palestinian Arabs. It is widely
            viewed as a catalyst for the 1948 Nakba and the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The UN Partition Plan (Resolution 181),https://honestreporting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/UN-Partition-Plan-featured-747x400-1.jpg.optimal.jpg,"<p>
            In 1947, facing mounting tensions and pressure to withdraw from
            Palestine, Britain referred the issue to the United Nations. The UN
            formed a committee (UNSCOP) to find a solution. The majority
            recommendation was to divide Palestine into two independent states:
            one Jewish and one Arab, with Jerusalem placed under international
            governance.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Jewish community supported this plan, seeing it as a legal
            foundation for the state of Israel. In contrast, the Arab
            population—and surrounding Arab nations—rejected it entirely,
            asserting that it violated the rights of the native majority.
            <br />
            <br />
            On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 181
            with 33 votes in favor, 13 against, and 10 abstentions. Despite
            international approval, the plan immediately sparked violence and
            deepened the division on the ground. It’s widely seen as the
            precursor to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the Nakba.

The Nakba (“Catastrophe”),https://arabcenterdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Nakba_twt-768x384.jpeg,"<p>

            The Nakba refers to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the
            1948 Arab-Israeli war, when over 750,000 people were forcibly
            expelled from their homes. Palestine—once a diverse, multicultural
            society—was fragmented. Villages were destroyed, families were
            separated, and an entire nation was uprooted.
            <br />
            <br />
            Following the UN partition plan, Zionist militias launched attacks
            that drove Palestinians from their towns and villages. As the
            British mandate ended and Israel declared independence, war erupted
            across the region. The result was the permanent dispossession of
            more than half the Palestinian population.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today, over 5 million Palestinian refugees remain displaced across
            the Middle East. The Nakba is not just a historical event—it is an
            ongoing experience of occupation, erasure, and denial of basic
            rights.

The Naksa (“Setback” - 1967),https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dd6436eb2385492db2ff92715a20c452_18.jpeg,"<p>The Naksa, meaning “setback” in Arabic, refers to the aftermath of the 
            <strong> 1967 Six-Day War</strong>, when Israel launched a preemptive strike 
            against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. In just six days, Israel captured the 
            <strong> West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula</strong>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Over <strong>300,000 more Palestinians were displaced</strong>, many of them 
            for the second time since the Nakba of 1948. The war marked the start of Israel’s ongoing 
            <strong> military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza</strong>, which continues today. </p>
            Israel also annexed East Jerusalem, a move unrecognized by most of the international community.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Naksa entrenched the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and deepened the refugee crisis. 
            It also led to the rise of Palestinian political resistance movements, including the PLO, and set 
            the stage for future uprisings such as the First Intifada.

The First Intifada (1987–1993),https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Intifada_in_Gaza_Strip%2C_1987_V_Dan_Hadani_Archive.jpg,"<p>The First Intifada was a grassroots uprising that began on December 8,
      1987, after an Israeli military vehicle collided with a civilian car in
      Gaza, killing four Palestinians. What followed was a mass rebellion across
      the occupied territories, especially in Gaza and the West Bank, fueled by
      two decades of Israeli occupation, economic hardship, and settlement
      expansion.
      <br />
      <br />
      Palestinians—especially youth—rose up using stones, strikes, graffiti,
      and protests. Israel responded with harsh crackdowns, including the use of
      live ammunition, curfews, mass arrests, and beatings. The UN Security
      Council condemned Israel’s excessive force. Over six years, more than 1,000
      Palestinians and over 100 Israelis were killed.
      <br />
      <br />
      The uprising ended with the 1993 Oslo Accords. The PLO recognized Israel,
      and Israel accepted the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian
      people. However, many—including groups like Hamas and figures such as
      Edward Said—viewed the agreement as a betrayal of Palestinian rights,
      especially the right of return and the liberation of all historic
      Palestine.

The Oslo Accords (1993–1995),https://www.peoplesworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/laaureates960.jpg,"<p>The Oslo Accords were a series of landmark agreements between Israel and
      the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), beginning with Oslo I signed
      on September 13, 1993. It marked the first time both sides officially
      recognized each other and pledged to end decades of conflict.
      <br />
      <br />
      Brokered in secret in Norway and announced in Washington, D.C., the accords
      led to the iconic handshake between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
      and PLO leader Yasser Arafat, under the auspices of U.S. President Bill
      Clinton. Oslo II followed in 1995, laying out detailed plans for
      self-governance and dividing the West Bank into Areas A, B, and C.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, the hope quickly faded. Israel continued building illegal
      settlements, while military occupation persisted. Rabin was assassinated
      in 1995 by a far-right Israeli opposed to the accords. Final status
      negotiations stalled indefinitely, and the creation of a sovereign
      Palestinian state never materialized.
      <br />
      <br />
      Many Palestinians now see the accords as a cover for further dispossession,
      with Israel using the peace process to entrench control over Palestinian
      land. Prominent critics, including Edward Said, warned early on that the
      deal represented capitulation, not justice.

The Second Intifada (Al-Aqsa Intifada),https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bf/Faris_odeh03a.jpg,"<p>The Second Intifada, also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada, erupted on{"" ""}
      <strong>September 28, 2000</strong>, after Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon
      entered the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem, accompanied by over
      1,000 armed forces. The visit came at a time of deep Palestinian frustration over
      stalled peace talks, settlement expansion, and Israel’s failure to meet the terms of
      the Oslo Accords.
      <br />
      <br />
      The uprising began with mass demonstrations, largely non-violent, but was met with
      excessive Israeli force. Within the first few days, Israel fired over 1.3 million
      bullets, killing 47 Palestinians—most of them civilians—and wounding nearly 2,000.
      The violent suppression militarized the uprising and led to years of bloody
      confrontation.
      <br />
      <br />
      Over the course of five years, at least <strong>4,973 Palestinians</strong> were killed,
      including <strong>1,262 children</strong>, and thousands more were injured. More than
      5,000 Palestinian homes were demolished, and countless others displaced. Despite the
      popular portrayal of violence, much of the Intifada included non-violent resistance,
      civil disobedience, and mass mobilization, which was largely ignored by Western media.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Second Intifada marked a significant shift in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
      It deepened occupation structures, hardened Israeli policies, and was later used to
      justify the building of the separation wall, expansion of settlements, and
      entrenchment of military control over Palestinian territories.

Hamas Wins Majority in 2006 Elections,https://assets.nationbuilder.com/cjpme/pages/2122/attachments/original/1470237658/hamas-anniversary-rally-gaza.jpg?1470237658,"<p>On <strong>January 26, 2006</strong>, Hamas won a stunning victory in the Palestinian
      parliamentary elections, securing <strong>76 out of 132 seats</strong> and ending the
      long-standing dominance of the Fatah movement. The election was widely seen as a
      rejection of Fatah's years of corruption, inefficiency, and failure to achieve
      tangible results in peace negotiations with Israel.
      <br />
      <br />
      The result triggered the resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia and his cabinet,
      even before final results were confirmed. President Mahmoud Abbas remained in office,
      but with Hamas now controlling the legislature, the dynamics of Palestinian politics
      shifted dramatically.
      <br />
      <br />
      Despite concerns from the international community, Hamas leaders such as{"" ""}
      <strong>Ismail Haniyeh</strong> and <strong>Khaled Mashaal</strong> struck a tone of
      cautious pragmatism, expressing openness to political partnership and internal reform.
      Some, like <strong>Mahmoud Zahar</strong>, indicated Hamas would maintain its truce if
      Israel reciprocated. However, other statements made it clear that Hamas would not
      recognize Israel nor prioritize peace negotiations.
      <br />
      <br />
      The victory was also aided by <strong>Fatah’s internal divisions</strong>, as multiple
      candidates split the party’s vote in many districts. Turnout reached nearly{"" ""}
      <strong>78%</strong> of 1.3 million eligible voters, demonstrating strong public
      engagement despite uncertainty and external pressure.
      <br />
      <br />
      The election marked the <strong>first time Hamas contested a parliamentary vote</strong>
      and brought about a seismic shift in Palestinian governance. Critics feared the win
      could deepen international isolation, while supporters hoped Hamas would bring reform
      and end internal dysfunction.

UN Recognizes Palestine (2012),https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/lM0QmgMOF0hQJnyLmu-_suJI9nOjqD4gtxlz4ckBGOiV0ti7Rl_AWcUbljxEcbyPi8tUOYabXMV4udiBUkSm6VJYC6kuZY3Vh-lF2_H69g,"<p>On <strong>November 29, 2012</strong>, the United Nations General Assembly voted to
      upgrade Palestine’s status to a <strong>non-member observer state</strong>. The vote
      passed with an overwhelming <strong>138 in favor</strong>, <strong>9 against</strong>,
      and <strong>41 abstentions</strong>.
      <br />
      <br />
      This upgrade was a symbolic but significant diplomatic step. It gave the Palestinians
      access to various international bodies, including the{"" ""}
      <strong>International Criminal Court (ICC)</strong>, and was widely seen as indirect
      recognition of a Palestinian state within the <strong>1967 borders</strong>, including
      the <strong>West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem</strong>.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>President Mahmoud Abbas</strong> told the assembly:{"" ""}
      <em>“The General Assembly is called upon today to issue a birth certificate of the
      reality of the State of Palestine.”</em> He emphasized the move was not meant to
      delegitimize Israel but to affirm Palestine’s right to statehood.
      <br />
      <br />
      While <strong>Palestinians celebrated</strong> across the West Bank and Gaza,{"" ""}
      <strong>Israel and the United States opposed</strong> the resolution, arguing that
      Palestinian statehood must come through direct negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister{"" ""}
      <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> called the UN vote “meaningless” and warned it
      would set back the peace process.
      <br />
      <br />
      The resolution followed years of stalled peace talks, mainly over Israel’s continued
      settlement expansion in the West Bank. Many European nations, including France and
      Italy, supported the resolution, while others remained divided.
      <br />
      <br />
      The move allowed Palestine to seek membership in more international organizations and
      pursue legal avenues for statehood. It also reflected global frustration with the lack
      of progress in negotiations and growing sympathy for the Palestinian cause.

Sheikh Jarrah & Gaza Conflict – 2021,https://springmag.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sheikh-jarrah-2021-afp.jpg,"<p>In <strong>May 2021</strong>, violence erupted across Israel and the occupied
      Palestinian territories in one of the most intense escalations since 2014. The
      conflict, often referred to as the <strong>2021 Israel–Palestine crisis</strong> or the
      <em> ""Unity Intifada""</em>, was triggered by Israeli efforts to forcibly evict
      Palestinian families from the <strong>Sheikh Jarrah</strong> neighborhood in East
      Jerusalem and Israeli police raids on the <strong>al-Aqsa Mosque compound</strong>
      during the final days of Ramadan.
      <br />
      <br />
      On <strong>May 10, 2021</strong>, after Israel ignored Hamas's ultimatum to withdraw its
      forces from Sheikh Jarrah and the al-Aqsa Mosque, <strong>Hamas and Islamic Jihad</strong> began
      launching rockets from Gaza into Israeli cities. In response, Israel initiated a massive
      aerial bombardment campaign across Gaza.
      <br />
      <br />
      The <strong>11-day war</strong> left at least <strong>256 Palestinians dead</strong>,
      including <strong>66 children</strong>, and more than <strong>1,900 injured</strong>. Israel reported
      <strong>13 deaths</strong>, including <strong>2 children</strong>, and hundreds injured.
      Over <strong>72,000 Palestinians were displaced</strong>, and <strong>94 buildings</strong>, including
      media offices and residential towers, were destroyed in Gaza.
      <br />
      <br />
      The UN and human rights groups condemned Israel's forced evictions and heavy-handed
      response. The <strong>UN OHCHR</strong> warned that evictions in Sheikh Jarrah may constitute
      <em> war crimes</em>. Organizations like <strong>B’Tselem</strong> and <strong>Human Rights Watch</strong>
      described Israel’s dual legal system in East Jerusalem as “apartheid.”
      <br />
      <br />
      The violence ended with an <strong>Egypt-brokered ceasefire</strong> on <strong>May 21, 2021</strong>, though
      both sides claimed victory. The events of May 2021 sparked widespread protests by
      Palestinians across Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, as well as solidarity demonstrations
      in cities around the world.
