## ✊ HackForPalestine

We are a group of developers and designers united by a common cause — using technology to amplify the voices of the Palestinian people.

This project was created as part of the **Hack For Gaza** hackathon organized by **Deen Developers**.

Our mission is clear: **Empower. Educate. Amplify.**
